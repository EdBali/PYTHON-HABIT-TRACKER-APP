    This class serves as a store for all the habits and streaks

        habits (dict): {Key = habit name,  Value = Habit instance}
        streaks (dict): {Key = habit instance,  Value = Streak instance}
        

    Methods:
        ==> add_habit(name,period): Creates a new habit object if it doesnt exist in the habits dictionary
        ==> deletehabit(name): Deletes the selected key value pair from the habits dictionary
        ==> complete_habit(name): Increments the counter of the selected Habit object,and adds the date of completion to the habit's Dates dictionary. Checks if a streak has been established. If a streak has been established, it creates a new Streak object or increments an existing one.
        ==> __add_streak(habit,period): Creates a new streak object if it doesnt exist in the dictionary, and assigns a period to the new streak. If it exists, it just calls the increase_count() method of the Streak class. Lastly, it adds the date on which this was done.
